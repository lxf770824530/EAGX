# Codes to generate datasets

There four datasets are used in our work, namely, BA-3motif, Mutagenicity, BBBP, and AIDS. The generation code of BA-3motif and Mutagenicity datasets can be found in the [code repository of ReFine](https://github.com/Wuyxin/ReFine)[^ Wang X, Wu Y, Zhang A, et al. Towards multi-grained explainability for graph neural networks[J]. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021, 34: 18446-18458.]. BBBP and AIDS are available on [pyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
